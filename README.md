# Node.js Learning Resources

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser.

[Node.js Build Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/build) maintains and controls infrastructure used for continuous integration (CI), releases, benchmarks, web hosting (of nodejs.org and other Node.js web properties) and more.

[The OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) is made up of 32 open source JavaScript projects including Appium, Dojo, Electron, jQuery, Node.js, and webpack. The foundation's mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
